   "source": "# Random Forest – Challenge: Customer Churn Prediction\n\n## Overview\n\nIn this notebook, we will walk through a comprehensive example of Random Forest classification to predict customer churn. No prior knowledge of ensemble methods is assumed. We will:\n\n- Introduce the concept of Random Forest and its advantages over single decision trees\n- Load and inspect the Customer Churn dataset (demographics, services, and billing information)\n- Visualise relationships between customer features and churn behaviour\n- Prepare mixed data types (categorical and numerical features) for machine learning\n- Build and tune a Random Forest classifier using cross-validation\n- Evaluate model performance with business-focused metrics (precision, recall)\n- Analyse feature importance to understand what drives customer churn\n- Provide actionable business recommendations based on model insights\n\n**Our Goal:** Can we accurately predict which customers are likely to churn based on their demographics, service usage, and billing information?\n\n## About the Dataset\n\n**Data Source:** [Telecom Customer Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)\n\nThis is a classic dataset used in business analytics and customer relationship management. Imagine you're a data scientist at a telecom company - your CEO wants to reduce customer churn to improve profitability. This model could help identify at-risk customers before they leave!\n\n### Dataset Context\n- **Total customers:** 7,043 telecom customers\n- **Features:** 20 customer attributes (demographics, services, billing)\n- **Target:** Churn status (Yes/No - did the customer leave?)\n- **Business impact:** Acquiring new customers costs 5-25x more than retaining existing ones\n- **Real-world application:** Proactive customer retention, targeted marketing campaigns\n\n### Customer Features in Our Dataset:\n\n**Demographics:**\n- **Gender, SeniorCitizen, Partner, Dependents** - Basic customer profile information\n\n**Account Information:**\n- **Tenure** - How long they've been a customer (months)\n- **Contract** - Month-to-month, One year, or Two year\n- **PaperlessBilling** - Electronic or paper billing preference  \n- **PaymentMethod** - How they pay their bills\n\n**Services:**\n- **PhoneService, MultipleLines** - Phone service details\n- **InternetService** - DSL, Fibre optic, or No internet\n- **OnlineSecurity, OnlineBackup, DeviceProtection, TechSupport** - Additional services\n- **StreamingTV, StreamingMovies** - Entertainment services\n\n**Billing:**\n- **MonthlyCharges** - Current monthly bill amount\n- **TotalCharges** - Total amount charged over the customer lifetime\n\n## What is Random Forest?\n\nThink of Random Forest like asking a committee of experts for their opinion, rather than relying on just one person!\n\n### The Decision Tree Foundation\n\nFirst, let's understand decision trees:\n- **The Idea:** A decision tree asks a series of yes/no questions to make a prediction\n- **Example:** \"Is monthly charge > $70?\" → \"Is contract month-to-month?\" → \"Predict: HIGH CHURN RISK\"\n- **Problem:** Single trees can be unreliable and overfit to training data\n\n### Random Forest: The Power of Many Trees\n\nRandom Forest combines hundreds of decision trees to make better predictions:\n\n1. **\"Forest\" of Trees:** Creates 100-500 different decision trees\n2. **Random Sampling:** Each tree sees a different random sample of customers  \n3. **Random Features:** Each tree considers only a random subset of features at each split\n4. **Democratic Voting:** Final prediction is based on majority vote of all trees\n5. **Wisdom of Crowds:** The ensemble is usually more accurate than any single tree\n\n**Example:** If 100 trees vote and 73 predict \"churn\" while 27 predict \"no churn\", the final prediction is \"churn\" with 73% confidence.\n\n### Why Random Forest is Perfect for Customer Churn:\n\n- **Handles Mixed Data:** Works great with both numbers (monthly charges) and categories (payment method)\n- **Feature Importance:** Tells us which customer attributes matter most for churn\n- **Robust Predictions:** Less likely to make mistakes than single decision trees\n- **No Overfitting:** The randomness prevents the model from memorising training data\n- **Business Interpretable:** Feature importance provides actionable insights\n\n**Additional Learning Resources:**\n- [StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ)\n- [Random Forest Algorithm Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6VJ2RO66Ag)"

   "source": "## Step 1: Loading and Exploring Our Customer Data\n\nBefore we can build any machine learning model, we need to understand our customers and their behaviour. In this step, we will:\n\n1. **Load the dataset** from a CSV file using pandas\n2. **Check the data structure** - How many customers and features do we have?\n3. **Look at churn distribution** - How many customers left vs. stayed?\n4. **Preview customer records** - What do actual customer profiles look like?\n5. **Visualise key relationships** - Which factors seem related to churn?\n\n### Understanding Our Customer Data Structure\n\nOur dataset contains **20 customer attributes** that we can group into four categories:\n\n| Category | Features | Description |\n|----------|----------|-------------|\n| **Demographics** | Gender, SeniorCitizen, Partner, Dependents | Basic customer profile |\n| **Account Info** | CustomerID, Tenure, Contract, PaperlessBilling, PaymentMethod | Account management |\n| **Services** | PhoneService, MultipleLines, InternetService, OnlineSecurity, OnlineBackup, DeviceProtection, TechSupport, StreamingTV, StreamingMovies | Service subscriptions |\n| **Billing** | MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges | Financial information |\n\n**Target Variable:** `Churn` - Whether the customer left the company (Yes/No)\n\n### Learning Lightbulb\n**What Are Predictors and Target Variables in Business Context?**\n- **Predictor Variables** (also called features, independent variables, or inputs) are the customer characteristics we can observe and measure.\n  - In our case: demographics (age, gender), services (internet type, phone service), and billing info (monthly charges, contract type)\n- **Target Variable** (also known as label, dependent variable, or outcome) is the business outcome we want to predict.\n  - Here, it's Churn - whether a customer will leave our company\n- **Business Value:** By understanding which customer characteristics predict churn, we can take proactive action to retain valuable customers\n\n### Why This Matters for Business\nCustomer churn analysis helps businesses:\n- **Reduce costs:** Preventing one customer from leaving saves 5-25x the cost of acquiring a new customer\n- **Increase revenue:** Retaining customers leads to higher lifetime value\n- **Improve targeting:** Focus retention efforts on highest-risk customers\n- **Optimise services:** Understand which services drive loyalty vs. churn\n\nLet's start exploring our customer data!",

   "source": "## Step 2: Preparing Our Customer Data for Machine Learning\n\nRaw customer data needs to be transformed before machine learning algorithms can work with it effectively. This step is crucial for getting good results. **\"Garbage in, garbage out\"** - if the input data is poorly prepared, even the best algorithms will produce unreliable results.\n\n### Why Do We Need Data Preprocessing for Customer Churn?\n\nOur customer dataset contains a **mix of data types** that need different handling:\n\n1. **Separate Features from Target**: We need to split our data into:\n   - **X (features)**: Customer attributes we'll use to predict churn\n   - **y (target)**: The churn outcome we want to predict\n\n2. **Handle Mixed Data Types**: Our dataset contains both:\n   - **Numerical features**: tenure (months), MonthlyCharges ($), TotalCharges ($)\n   - **Categorical features**: gender, Contract, PaymentMethod, InternetService, etc.\n\n3. **Data Transformation Pipeline**: Each data type needs different preprocessing:\n   - **Numerical features** → StandardScaler (normalise to mean=0, std=1)\n   - **Categorical features** → OneHotEncoder (convert text to numbers)\n\n### Understanding Our Preprocessing Strategy\n\n**StandardScaler for Numerical Features:**\n- Random Forest can handle different scales better than some algorithms, but standardisation still helps\n- Ensures features contribute equally to distance-based calculations in the algorithm\n- Example: Monthly charges ($20-$120) and tenure (1-72 months) will have similar scales\n\n**OneHotEncoder for Categorical Features:**\n- Converts categories into binary columns (0 or 1)\n- Example: Contract → Contract_Month-to-month, Contract_One year, Contract_Two year\n- **drop='first'**: Removes one category to avoid multicollinearity\n- **handle_unknown='ignore'**: Gracefully handles new categories in test data\n\n### Learning Lightbulb\n**Why Can't We Just Use Text Directly in Machine Learning?**\n- Machine learning algorithms work with numbers, not text\n- Categories like \"Male\"/\"Female\" need to become numbers like 0/1\n- **One-Hot Encoding** creates separate columns for each category:\n  - Original: Gender = [\"Male\", \"Female\", \"Male\"]\n  - Encoded: Gender_Male = [1, 0, 1], Gender_Female = [0, 1, 0]\n- This allows the algorithm to understand categorical relationships without imposing artificial ordering\n\n### ColumnTransformer: The Swiss Army Knife of Preprocessing\n\nWe'll use **ColumnTransformer** to apply different preprocessing to different column types simultaneously:\n- Automatically identifies which columns get which transformations\n- Combines all transformations into a single preprocessing step\n- Ensures consistent preprocessing between training and test data\n\nThis preprocessing approach ensures our Random Forest model gets clean, properly formatted data that maximises prediction accuracy!",

   "source": "## Step 3: Splitting Our Customer Data - Training vs. Testing\n\nNow we need to split our customer data into two parts. This is a **fundamental concept** in business machine learning that ensures our model can actually help make real-world decisions!\n\n### Why Split Customer Data?\n- **Training data:** The customers our model learns from to understand churn patterns\n- **Test data:** \"Future customers\" our model has never seen - simulates real-world deployment\n- **Business validation:** Ensures our churn prediction model will work on new customers, not just memorise existing ones\n\n### Our Customer Split Strategy: 70/30 with Stratification\n\n- **70% for training** (~4,930 customers): We'll use these customer profiles to teach our Random Forest\n- **30% for testing** (~2,113 customers): We'll use these to simulate how well our model predicts churn for new customers\n\n### Critical Parameter: Stratification\n\n**Why is stratification crucial for churn prediction?**\n\nOur customer base has an **imbalanced churn rate** (typically ~25-30% churn). Without stratification:\n- Training set might have 35% churners\n- Test set might have 20% churners  \n- Model performance would be misleading!\n\n**Stratification ensures both sets have the same churn rate as the original dataset.**\n\n### Learning Lightbulb\n**Business Impact of Proper Data Splitting**\n- **Poor splitting:** Model appears 90% accurate in testing but fails in production\n- **Proper stratified splitting:** Realistic performance estimates that match deployment results\n- **ROI Impact:** Prevents costly deployment of ineffective churn prediction models\n- **Business confidence:** Stakeholders can trust model performance metrics\n\n### Key Parameters Explained:\n\n- **`test_size=0.3`:** Use 30% of customers for testing (industry standard for churn prediction)\n- **`stratify=y`:** Maintain the same churn rate in both training and test sets\n  - If overall churn rate is 26.5%, both train and test will have ~26.5% churn\n  - Critical for imbalanced business problems like churn, fraud detection, medical diagnosis\n- **`random_state=42`:** Ensures reproducible results (same customer split every time we run this code)\n  - Important for business stakeholders who need consistent model validation\n\n### Business Rationale:\n\nThis split strategy simulates a realistic business scenario:\n1. **Training phase:** Analyse historical customer data to identify churn patterns  \n2. **Deployment phase:** Apply learnt patterns to predict churn for current/new customers\n3. **Success metric:** How well the model identifies at-risk customers it has never seen before\n\nThis approach gives us confidence that our churn prediction model will deliver real business value when deployed!",

This is called **hyperparameter tuning** and it's crucial for maximising business value from our churn prediction model.\n\n### Why Hyperparameter Tuning Matters for Churn Prediction\n\nDefault Random Forest settings work reasonably well, but **optimal settings can dramatically improve business results:**\n- **Better accuracy:** More churners correctly identified\n- **Fewer false alarms:** Less wasted effort on customers who won't actually churn  \n- **Higher ROI:** Better resource allocation for retention campaigns\n- **Stakeholder confidence:** Demonstrable improvement through systematic optimisation\n\n### Key Random Forest Hyperparameters for Business Applications\n\nWe'll optimise three critical hyperparameters that have the biggest impact on churn prediction:\n\n#### 1. **n_estimators**: Size of the Forest (Number of Trees)\n- **What it controls:** How many decision trees to include in the forest\n- **Business impact:** More trees = more stable predictions, but diminishing returns\n- **Our range:** 50, 100, 200 trees\n- **Trade-off:** More trees take longer to train but usually give better predictions (up to a point)\n\n#### 2. **Cross-Validation**: Testing Different Forest Sizes\n- **What we do:** Test each forest size using 3-fold cross-validation\n- **Why it matters:** Ensures we pick the forest size that works best on unseen data\n- **Business benefit:** Prevents overfitting and gives realistic performance estimates\n\n### Learning Lightbulb\n**Cross-Validation: The Business-Safe Way to Optimise**\n\nWe can't use our test set to choose hyperparameters (that would be \"cheating\"!). Instead, we use **cross-validation** on training data:\n\n1. **Split training data into 3 folds** (subsets)\n2. **For each forest size:**\n   - Train on 2 folds, validate on the remaining fold\n   - Repeat 3 times (each fold gets to be the validation set)\n   - Average the 3 performance scores\n3. **Select the forest size with best average performance**\n\n**Business benefit:** This approach gives us realistic performance estimates and prevents overfitting to our specific dataset.\n\n### What We're Looking For\n\nWe'll test different numbers of trees and see which gives the best accuracy:\n- **Accuracy:** Overall percentage of correct churn predictions\n- **Cross-validation:** Ensures results are reliable and not just lucky\n\nLet's find the optimal forest size for our customer churn prediction model!",

We'll test our optimised Random Forest on the \"unseen\" customer data to see how well it predicts churn in realistic business conditions.\n\n### Why Test Set Evaluation is Critical for Business\n\n- **Simulates deployment:** Test data represents future customers our model has never seen\n- **Prevents overfitting:** Ensures our model works beyond the training data\n- **Business confidence:** Provides realistic performance estimates for stakeholders\n- **Investment decision:** Determines if the model justifies implementation costs\n\n### Business-Critical Metrics for Churn Prediction\n\nWe'll evaluate multiple metrics because **different metrics matter for different business decisions:**\n\n#### 1. **Accuracy: The Overall Success Rate**\n- **What it measures:** Percentage of customers we classify correctly (churn vs. no churn)\n- **Business interpretation:** Overall effectiveness of our churn prediction system\n- **Limitation:** Can be misleading if dataset is imbalanced (more loyal than churning customers)\n\n#### 2. **Confusion Matrix: Understanding Model Mistakes**\nShows exactly where our predictions go wrong:\n- **True Positives:** Correctly identified churners (saved customers)\n- **True Negatives:** Correctly identified loyal customers (no wasted effort)\n- **False Positives:** Predicted churn but customer stayed (wasted retention cost)\n- **False Negatives:** Missed actual churners (lost customers)\n\n#### 3. **Precision and Recall: The Business Impact Metrics**\n- **Precision:** Of customers we predict will churn, how many actually do?  \n  - **Business impact:** High precision = fewer wasted retention efforts\n  - **Example:** 80% precision means 4 out of 5 retention campaigns target actual churners\n  \n- **Recall (Sensitivity):** Of customers who actually churn, how many do we catch?\n  - **Business impact:** High recall = fewer customers slip through the cracks\n  - **Example:** 75% recall means we identify 3 out of 4 customers who will actually churn\n\n### Learning Lightbulb\n**Why Accuracy Alone Can Be Misleading in Churn Prediction**\n\nIf 75% of customers don't churn, a \"dumb\" model that always predicts \"no churn\" gets 75% accuracy! But this model is useless for business because:\n- It never identifies any at-risk customers\n- Zero value for retention campaigns\n- Misses the entire point of churn prediction\n\nThis is why we use precision and recall for imbalanced business problems like churn prediction.\n\n### Business Decision Framework\n\nBased on our evaluation, we'll determine:\n- **Is the model ready for deployment?** Performance threshold analysis\n- **What's the optimal prediction threshold?** Balance precision vs recall\n- **Which customers should get retention offers?** Probability-based targeting\n- **What's the expected ROI?** Cost-benefit analysis of model deployment\n\nLet's see how our Random Forest performs in the real-world test!",

   "source": "## Step 6: Unlocking Business Insights - Feature Importance & Strategic Recommendations\n\nOne of Random Forest's greatest strengths is **interpretability** - it tells us exactly which customer characteristics drive churn. This transforms our model from a \"black box\" into a strategic business tool that guides decision-making.\n\n### Why Feature Importance is Gold for Business Strategy\n\n**Feature importance scores reveal:**\n- **Which customer attributes matter most** for churn prediction\n- **Where to focus retention efforts** for maximum impact  \n- **What operational changes** could reduce churn rates\n- **How to segment customers** for targeted campaigns\n- **Which data to collect** for future model improvements\n\n### Understanding Random Forest Feature Importance\n\n**How it works:**\n- Each tree in the forest makes decisions by asking questions about customer features\n- Features that consistently provide the most \"information gain\" across all trees get higher importance scores\n- Scores are normalised so all features sum to 100%\n\n**Business interpretation:**\n- **High importance (>10%):** Critical driver of churn - major strategic focus area\n- **Medium importance (5-10%):** Important factor - tactical optimisation opportunity  \n- **Low importance (<5%):** Minor factor - monitor but don't over-invest\n\n### Learning Lightbulb\n**From Feature Importance to Business Action**\n\nRaw feature importance is just the beginning. The real value comes from translating these insights into:\n\n1. **Operational Changes:** Improve services that drive churn\n2. **Customer Segmentation:** Group customers by risk factors  \n3. **Retention Campaigns:** Target interventions based on churn drivers\n4. **Product Development:** Address root causes of customer dissatisfaction\n5. **Pricing Strategy:** Optimise pricing models based on churn sensitivities\n\n### What We'll Discover\n\nOur analysis will reveal:\n- **Top 10 churn predictors** with business explanations\n- **Customer risk profiles** based on feature combinations\n- **Actionable recommendations** for each major churn driver\n- **Strategic priorities** for reducing overall churn rate\n- **ROI opportunities** for retention investments\n\nThis analysis transforms data science insights into executive-ready strategic recommendations!",

   "source": "## Conclusion & Executive Summary\n\n**Executive Summary**  \nOur Random Forest classifier successfully predicts customer churn with strong business-ready performance (accuracy ~80%). This model can identify at-risk customers before they leave, enabling proactive retention campaigns that significantly improve profitability.\n\n**Key Business Findings**  \n\n**Model Performance**\n- **Accuracy:** 80%+ (Good business performance for churn prediction)\n- **Precision:** ~65-75% of predicted churners actually churn (reasonable retention campaign efficiency)\n- **Recall:** ~60-70% of actual churners are identified (solid coverage of at-risk customers)\n- **Business Impact:** Model can distinguish churners from loyal customers significantly better than random guessing\n\n**Critical Churn Drivers Identified**\n1. **Customer Tenure:** New customers (< 12 months) are highest churn risk\n2. **Monthly Charges:** Higher bills strongly correlate with churn likelihood  \n3. **Contract Type:** Month-to-month contracts drive significantly higher churn vs. annual/multi-year\n4. **Internet Service:** Fibre optic customers show elevated churn rates (service quality concerns?)\n5. **Payment Method:** Electronic cheque users exhibit higher churn patterns\n6. **Add-on Services:** Customers without online security/tech support are more likely to leave\n\n**Actionable Business Recommendations**\n\n**Immediate High-Impact Actions**\n- **Revamp onboarding:** Implement 90-day new customer success program to improve early tenure retention\n- **Pricing optimisation:** Review high monthly charge customers for retention pricing offers\n- **Contract incentives:** Aggressively promote annual contracts with meaningful discounts\n- **Service quality:** Investigate and address fibre optic service delivery issues\n\n**Medium-Term Strategic Initiatives**\n- **Service bundling:** Increase adoption of online security and tech support services\n- **Payment optimisation:** Incentivise automatic payment methods over electronic cheques\n- **Demographic targeting:** Develop specialised retention programs for senior citizens\n- **Predictive campaigns:** Deploy model to score all customers monthly and trigger proactive outreach\n\n**Financial Impact Framework**\n- **Cost Avoidance:** Preventing customer churn saves 5-25x the cost of acquiring new customers\n- **Campaign Efficiency:** Model enables targeting ~65-75% accuracy vs. random ~25% baseline\n- **ROI Calculation:** If average customer lifetime value is $1,000 and retention campaigns cost $50, the positive ROI is substantial even with model imperfections\n\n**Next Steps for Implementation**\n1. **Model Deployment:** Integrate into customer database for monthly churn scoring\n2. **Business Process:** Establish retention team workflows for high-probability churners  \n3. **A/B Testing:** Test retention campaign effectiveness on model-identified segments\n4. **Continuous Improvement:** Monitor model performance and retrain quarterly with new data\n5. **Feature Enhancement:** Collect additional behavioural data to improve prediction accuracy\n\n---\n\n**Bottom Line:** This Random Forest model transforms customer churn from a reactive problem into a proactive business advantage. By focusing retention efforts on algorithmically-identified high-risk segments, businesses can systematically reduce churn rates and maximise customer lifetime value."
