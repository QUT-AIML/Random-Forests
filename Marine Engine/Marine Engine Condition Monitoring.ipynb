    "## Step 4: Data Preprocessing for Mixed Industrial Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Marine engine data combines sensor readings (numerical) with equipment specifications (categorical). Random Forest handles mixed data well, but proper preprocessing is still crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Major Preprocessing Tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify Feature Types:** Separate numerical sensors from categorical equipment data\n",
    "2. **Handle Missing Values:** Check for and handle any sensor reading gaps\n",
    "3. **Remove Non-Predictive Features:** Drop timestamp, engine_id if they don't add value\n",
    "4. **Create Preprocessing Pipeline:** Use ColumnTransformer for mixed data handling\n",
    "5. **Feature Scaling:** StandardScaler for sensor readings (optional for Random Forest)\n",
    "6. **Categorical Encoding:** OneHotEncoder for equipment specifications\n",
    "7. **Train/Test Split:** Stratified split to maintain maintenance class balance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Each Step Matters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feature type identification:** Different preprocessing for sensors vs specifications\n",
    "- **Missing value handling:** Sensor failures could be predictive or problematic\n",
    "- **Non-predictive features:** Engine ID won't help predict other engines\n",
    "- **Mixed data pipeline:** Consistent preprocessing for numerical and categorical features\n",
    "- **Stratified split:** Maintains realistic maintenance class proportions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Industrial Data Considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sensor ranges:** Different sensors have vastly different scales (RPM vs temperature)\n",
    "- **Equipment categories:** Engine types, manufacturers create distinct groups\n",
    "- **Time features:** Consider if timestamp adds temporal patterns\n",
    "- **Operational context:** Running period and load affect sensor readings"
